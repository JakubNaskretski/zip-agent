# pptx-skill — v5 agent contract

You are composing PowerPoint decks from a library of **structural
skeletons** (slide layouts with typed slots + constraints) and
**themes** (master + palette + fonts). You pick skeletons by
*function and fit*, fill their slots with your content, and the
consumer builds the deck on the chosen host theme.

## The flow

1. **List what's available**
   ```bash
   python reader.py list-themes
   python reader.py list-skeletons [--category data] [--has-slot table]
   ```

2. **Find skeletons that fit your content**
   ```bash
   python reader.py match-skeletons \
     --content '{"title": "Q4 results beat", "bullets": ["Revenue +12%", "Margin up"]}' \
     --category data
   ```
   Returns ranked candidates with `fit_score`, `slot_mapping`, and
   `headroom`. Higher `fit_score` = tighter fit (the layout was
   designed for that content length — loose fit wastes the layout).

3. **If zero matches: rephrase, don't pick a near-miss**
   When `match-skeletons` returns `matches: []`, each `issues[]` entry
   includes a concrete `suggested_action` ("rephrase to ≤60 chars
   (drop 13)"). Your job is to **shorten the content**, not to pick
   a skeleton whose constraints don't match. Re-call `match-skeletons`
   after rephrasing.

   `issues[]` may also carry `missing_required` entries
   (`{skeleton_id, missing_required: [{slot_id, kind}], suggested_action}`):
   that skeleton fit your content but demands content for more slots
   (e.g. a required chart). Either add content for those slot kinds
   and re-match, or filter to a different category/skeleton.

   **Escape hatch.** If rephrasing would lose meaning (text is
   already terse), wrap the value in the plan as
   `{"value": "...", "overflow": "shrink"}`. The build engine will
   auto-shrink the font and emit a warning to a sidecar file for
   the user to review manually. Use sparingly.

4. **Pre-flight check the full plan**
   ```bash
   python reader.py validate-plan plan.json
   ```
   Returns `{ok, errors, warnings}`. Hard errors block the build.
   `overflow:shrink` violations land as warnings, not errors.

   Every `asset_<id>` in the plan is resolved against the asset
   library — an unknown id is a hard error (`unknown_asset`); take
   ids from `find-asset`, never invent them. An existing asset whose
   aspect mismatches the slot is a warning. The placeholder forms
   (`"placeholder"` / `{"placeholder": true, ...}`) validate clean.

5. **Hand off (or build, if you have the binaries)**

   In the typical authoring brief flow your job ends here: emit the
   validated `plan.json` and stop. The user runs compose-v5 in the
   local app where the asset binaries live.

   If you're working from a full `skill-v5.zip` (binaries present —
   see "What's in the bundle" below), you can also build the deck
   yourself:
   ```bash
   python reader.py compose-v5 plan.json out.pptx --theme <theme_id>
   ```
   Picks one host theme per output deck. All slides inherit the
   theme's master (brand bars, page numbers, footer), palette, and
   fonts. The skeletons are theme-free; identity comes from the host.

   compose-v5 re-runs the validator first: hard errors abort the
   build (errors as JSON, exit 1) unless you pass `--force`, which
   carries them into the warnings sidecar instead. Validation
   warnings and build-time `overflow:shrink` events always land in
   `<out>.pptx.warnings.json` for the user to review.

## Slot kinds

| Kind | Content shape | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `heading` | string | `max_chars`, `max_lines`, `required` |
| `paragraph` | string | `max_chars`, `max_lines`, `required` |
| `bullets` | list of strings | `max_items`, `max_chars_per_item`, `required` |
| `image` | `"asset_<id>"`, `{"asset": "asset_<id>"}`, or `"placeholder"` / `{"placeholder": true, "label": "..."}` for a labeled grey box | `aspect`, `required`, `auto_fit` |
| `table` | `{"rows": N, "cols": N, "has_header": bool, "data": [[...]]}` | `max_rows`, `max_cols`, `has_header` |
| `chart` | `{"type": "bar\|column\|line\|pie\|doughnut\|area" (+ `_stacked` / `_markers` variants), "categories": ["..."], "series": [{"name": "...", "values": [...]}]}` | `chart_type`, `max_series`, `max_categories` |
| `footer` | string | `max_chars`, `max_lines`, `auto_from_host` |

Each slot also carries `geometry` (fractional `x/y/w/h`) and a
`style` block with theme-relative tokens (`font_role: major|minor|
explicit`, `color_role: primary|accent|text_default|background`)
that get resolved against the chosen host theme at build time.

## Plan shape

```json
[
  {
    "skeleton_id": "deckA_03",
    "slots": {
      "title": "Q4 results beat consensus",
      "body": ["Revenue +12%", "Margin expanded 200bps", "FCF positive"],
      "hero": "asset_a1b2c3d4"
    }
  },
  {
    "skeleton_id": "deckA_07",
    "slots": {
      "title": {"value": "A slightly longer title", "overflow": "shrink"},
      "data_table": {
        "rows": 3, "cols": 2, "has_header": true,
        "data": [["Quarter", "Revenue"], ["Q3", "$1.2M"], ["Q4", "$1.8M"]]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Engine-side helpers

Don't compute character counts, aspect ratios, or EMU coordinates
yourself — call these instead:

```bash
python reader.py measure-text "Q4 results" --against deckA_03.title
python reader.py check-asset-fit asset_a1b2 deckA_03 hero
python reader.py find-asset --kind photo --tags people --tags office
```

`measure-text` returns `{chars, words, lines_est}` and, with
`--against`, the headroom for a specific slot. `check-asset-fit`
returns whether the asset fits a target image slot (aspect, kind,
resolution) plus a `suggestion` if not. `find-asset` returns a
deterministic shortlist — see "Picking images" below.

## Picking images

For every image slot, **call `find-asset` first** — do not scan
`index.json` and pick by `description` text. The shortlist is filtered
purely on `kind` (required) and `tags` (optional, AND-matched against
a closed workspace vocabulary), so two runs with the same query
produce the same candidates in the same order.

The valid tag list ships in `index.json` under `tag_vocab` (and is
echoed on every `find-asset` response). Don't invent tags — anything
outside that list cannot match.

```bash
python reader.py find-asset \
  --kind photo \
  --tags people --tags office \
  --limit 5
```

Each match carries `description` (the one-line summary), `tags`,
mechanical dimensions (`width`, `height`, `aspect`), and `colors_hex`.
Use `description` to pick the final 1-of-N by topic fit; use the
dimensions if you want to pre-filter the shortlist for aspect-friendly
candidates (or just defer to `check-asset-fit`).

Algorithm:

1. Call `find-asset` with the slot's required `kind` plus 1–3
   `--tags` that name what should be in the picture (people, office,
   chart, etc. — read `tag_vocab` for the live list).
2. If `matches: []`, retry without `--tags` (one broadening step).
   If still empty, jump to step 4.
3. From the surviving shortlist, pick by `description` fit to the
   slide topic. Optionally run `check-asset-fit` against the slot to
   filter out aspect-incompatible candidates.
4. If nothing fits and the slot is **not** required, omit it — the
   build skips the slot.
5. If the slot IS required and nothing fits, use a **placeholder**
   — the canonical fallback. Pass `"placeholder"` (the literal
   string) as the asset value. The build draws a dashed grey box
   labeled `image needed: <slot_id>` and emits a warning in the
   sidecar so the user knows to swap it in by hand. Pass
   `{"placeholder": true, "label": "Customer logo here"}` for a
   custom hint label. Both forms pass validate-plan.
   (Only if your setup has network access to the authoring host —
   most on-prem runs do not — you may instead stage a new image via
   `POST /api/asset/add` and use the returned `asset_id` in the
   plan.)

Don't pick assets by reading `index.json` directly past `find-asset`'s
shortlist. The deterministic selector is the only place that's
guaranteed idempotent.

## Categories

Skeletons carry one or more functional categories — use these to
filter `list-skeletons` / `match-skeletons`:

`opening` (title / agenda) · `section_divider` (between sections) ·
`content` (general body) · `comparison` (2-column side-by-side) ·
`data` (table or chart heavy) · `metric` (single large stat) ·
`quote` (pull-quote, testimonial) · `closing` (Q&A, thank you,
next steps).

A skeleton can have multiple categories (a "Thank you" closing
slide that's also opening-shaped is `[opening, closing]`).

## What the agent does NOT do

- Re-render slides yourself; `compose-v5` owns slide construction.
- Pick a near-miss skeleton instead of rephrasing.
- Mix multiple host themes in one output deck (one `--theme` per
  build).
- Re-style master decorations (brand bars, page numbers) — those
  ride along with the chosen host theme.

## What's in the bundle

Two delivery modes — same SKILL.md, different file inventory:

**A) Authoring brief bundle** (the one most users ship). Text-only.
Typical size: ~100 KB. Built by the local /compose web app. Flat
layout — one YAML per item, no per-item dirs (no binaries means
no need to group multiple files per item).

```
SKILL.md                        you are reading this
reader.py                       used for read-only queries (find-asset,
                                check-asset-fit, match-skeletons,
                                validate-plan, list-themes, list-skeletons)
requirements.txt                PyYAML only — the read-only commands need
                                nothing else (python-pptx is required only
                                by compose-v5, which you don't run here)
tag_vocab.yaml                  closed tag list for assets
index.json                      summaries of every theme/skeleton/asset
brand.md                        (optional) per-org style constraints
brief.md                        the user's request
themes/<id>.yaml                palette + fonts
skeletons/<id>.yaml             slots, geometry, style, constraints, categories
assets/<id>.yaml                asset descriptions (kind, tags, description,
                                width, height, aspect, colors_hex)
user_assets/<id>.<ext>          (optional) low-res previews of images the
                                user attached to THIS request
user_assets/manifest.json       (optional) original dimensions + filenames
```

In this mode your job ends at producing the plan — the user runs
compose-v5 locally where the full-res asset binaries live. **Do
NOT try to run compose-v5 yourself; the binaries aren't present.**

**B) Static skill-v5.zip** (built via `cli build-v5`). Self-contained.

```
... everything from (A), plus:
themes/<id>/master.pptx         host master for compose-v5
themes/<id>/preview.png         optional
skeletons/<id>/preview.png      optional source-slide thumbnail
skeletons/<id>/background.png   optional frozen underlay
assets/<id>.<ext>               actual raster / SVG / XML binaries
```

In this mode you can additionally run:
```bash
python reader.py compose-v5 plan.json out.pptx --theme <theme_id>
```

How to tell which mode you're in: check whether `assets/<id>.<ext>`
binaries exist (a quick `ls assets/` shows `.yaml` files always; the
sibling binaries are present only in mode B).

No network. No state. No vision required at compose time.
